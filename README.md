# [WIP] HackerTube
A no shit Youtube, for people who love HackerNews

## Why?
Because frankly, YouTube has a shitload of fuck-all content and Hackernews people won't stand to this mediocrity. 

## How?
- regularly scrapes hackernews and vubble using celery.
- records the video links obtained in djnago models.
- a react frontend fetches these objects using django-rest-framework

## 🌟🍬🍬🌟
- Maintains youtube playlists every day so you can relax with a 🍺 
- Separates content based on sources so you can choose more/less `Hacker-esque` content
